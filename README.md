# public_web_encryption

<p>
  This is an implementation of a public webpage encrypted with a key.
  The content is stored as a token and can't be viewed until decrypted by the visitor.
  This method allows the hosting of sensitive material statically without using an API for authentication.
  All the visitor has to do is input the right combination in order to view the web content.
